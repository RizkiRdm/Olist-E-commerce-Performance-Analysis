## 1. System Components & Workflow

The system is designed to transform raw transaction data into actionable insights through a structured data pipeline, visualized via interactive dashboards.

### 1.1 Data Sources

* **Transactional Data:** Orders, order items, payments, customer details, and product information from Olist's core databases.
* **Marketing Campaign Data:** Specific campaign details linked to customer interactions (if available).

### 1.2 Data Pipeline (ETL Process)

* **Extraction:** Automated retrieval of the latest data from source systems (e.g., daily/weekly SQL queries or API calls).
* **Transformation:** Cleansing, merging, and calculation of all defined RFM metrics and segment-specific KPIs. This step consolidates raw data into analytical-ready formats.
* **Loading:** Populating a dedicated **Data Warehouse** (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift) with the transformed data, optimized for fast querying and reporting.

### 1.3 Analytics & Visualization Layer

* **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools:** Primary platform for dashboard creation and interactive reporting (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio). These tools will connect directly to the Data Warehouse.
* **Advanced Analytics (Optional):** Python/R environments for deeper ad-hoc analysis, predictive modeling (e.g., refining CLTV predictions), and complex segmentation algorithm development.

### 1.4 Automation & Reporting

* **Scheduled Jobs:** Automated execution of the data pipeline at regular intervals (e.g., nightly) to ensure dashboards are always up-to-date.
* **Dashboards:**
    * **Main RFM Dashboard:** Overview of segment distribution trends, overall CLTV, Churn Rate, and AOV.
    * **Segment-Specific Dashboards:** Detailed views of KPIs pertinent to each RFM segment (e.g., Reactivation Rate for 'Hibernating' customers, Second Purchase Rate for 'Single Buyers (Recent)').
* **Automated Reports:** Regular (e.g., weekly/monthly) summary reports delivered to key stakeholders via email.

## 2. Strategic Impact & Iteration

This monitoring system empowers Olist to:

* **Measure Performance:** Quantify the success of tailored marketing initiatives for each segment.
* **Identify Trends & Anomalies:** Quickly spot changes in customer behavior or segment shifts.
* **Optimize Resources:** Continuously refine marketing spend and effort based on data-driven insights.
* **Drive Continuous Improvement:** Facilitate an iterative cycle of strategy adjustment, campaign execution, and performance measurement, ensuring agility in customer engagement.

## Conclusion

By implementing this structured monitoring and reporting framework, Olist will move beyond reactive decision-making to a proactive, data-informed approach to customer segmentation and marketing. This ensures that resources are effectively utilized to maximize customer lifetime value and retention.
