# RFM-Based Customer Segmentation: Monitoring & Iteration Plan

This document outlines key metrics to track the effectiveness of our RFM-based marketing strategies and monitor segment performance over time.

## Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To understand if our strategies are working, we need to measure specific things. These are our KPIs:
